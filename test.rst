Reddit
================================================================================
The `Ethereum subreddit`_ is the most inclusive Ethereum forum, where most of the community discussion is happening and where core devs are also active. This is your forum of choice for generic discussion of news, media coverage, announcements, brainstorming. In general all things Ethereum relevant to the wider community.

Strictly no price discussion.

Also, this is not the ideal place to ask for hands-on help or post questions you expect there are clear immediate answers to (use :ref:`gitter-rooms` and :ref:`stack-exchange` for these, respectively).

Read the `Ethereum subreddit rules`_ before posting.
